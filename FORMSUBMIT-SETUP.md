# FormSubmit Contact Form Setup

## ✅ Your Contact Form is Now Live!

Your contact form now uses **FormSubmit** - a free, reliable form submission service that works perfectly with static websites.

---

## 📧 **Who Receives Form Submissions?**

When someone submits the contact form, emails are sent to:

1. **Primary:** `topdoggliquors@gmail.com`
2. **CC Copy:** `nashvillendg@gmail.com`

Both email addresses will receive every form submission.

---

## 🎯 **How It Works:**

1. User fills out the form on your contact page
2. Clicks "Send Message"
3. **FormSubmit processes the submission** (no email client needed!)
4. **Email sent instantly** to both email addresses
5. User is redirected back to contact page with **success message**

---

## 📨 **What the Email Looks Like:**

**Subject:** `New Contact Form Submission - Top Dogg Liquors`

**Body (formatted as table):**
```
Name:     [User's Name]
Email:    [User's Email]
Phone:    [User's Phone]
Subject:  [User's Subject]
Message:  [User's Message]
```

## 🔧 **Important: First-Time Activation**

### **IMPORTANT - ONE-TIME SETUP REQUIRED!**

The first time someone submits the form, **FormSubmit will send a confirmation email** to `topdoggliquors@gmail.com`.

**YOU MUST:**
1. Check your inbox at `topdoggliquors@gmail.com`
2. Look for email from FormSubmit
3. **Click the activation link** in that email
4. After activation, all future submissions work automatically!

**This only happens ONCE** - the very first submission.
