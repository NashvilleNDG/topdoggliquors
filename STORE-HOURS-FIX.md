## ✅ SCHEMA MARKUP VERIFIED

The structured data (Schema.org) on index.html already has the correct hours:

```json
"openingHoursSpecification": [
  {
    "dayOfWeek": ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday"],
    "opens": "09:00",
    "closes": "21:50"
  },
  {
    "dayOfWeek": ["Friday", "Saturday"],
    "opens": "09:00",
    "closes": "22:50"
  },
  {
    "dayOfWeek": "Sunday",
    "opens": "10:00",
    "closes": "21:50"
  }
]
```

This tells Google the correct hours for your business listing.
